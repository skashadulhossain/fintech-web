              <p>
                With our Mobile Recharge API, recharging becomes as simple as a
                single click. We provide a code snippet that seamlessly
                integrates with your existing website. An interface page allows
                you to place recharge orders for various operators. Once the
                recharge is processed, the amount is deducted from your wallet.
                Additionally, you can track your wallet balance, view
                commissions earned, access recharge history, and check the
                status of each transactionâ€”all from your wallet page.
